## Objective

Setup options menus and accessibility features in about 15 minutes.

This addon plugs into an existing project. It is game agnostic (2D or 3D) and can work with multiple target resolutions, up to 4k and down to 640x360. It's meant to cover the needs for a typical game jam, while remaining scalable and extensible enough to support commercial games.

## Features

### Base

The `base/` folder holds the core components of the menus application.

-   Options Menus
-   Persistent Settings
-   Simple Config Interface
-   Keyboard/Mouse Support
-   Gamepad Support

### Extras or Components
